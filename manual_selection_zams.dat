# This list holds the fine tuning parameters for those clusters that
# were manually selected to trace the ZAMS.
#
# * NAME: name of the hand-picked cluster.
# * lev_num: minimum number of contour level to be accepted. The levels
# start from 0 which is assigned to the outermost one.
# * method: 0 is the default contour's diametral pair method and 1 is the
# stars interpolating method.
# * y_min, y_max: Magnitude range where the sequences will be interpolated.
# * x_min, x_max: Color range where the sequences will be interpolated.
